# SellSword - A Call to Arms Rewards Finder
Admit it. The only reason you even run LFG Heroics or Raids anymore is for the bonus rewards from Call to Arms queues. You know what that makes you? A mercenary. A sellsword. That's okay, embrace it! I'm one as well!

This addon will scan the LFG queues and notify you when one of them has a Call to Arms reward attached to it. Inspired by the Satchel Scanner addon, this addon also tracks Timewalking rewards as well as Looking for Raid rewards.

By default this addon automatically starts scanning for rewards the moment you log in. To disable, head into the options and de-select the Auto Scan check box. Queue Call to Arms rewards are scanned for every 3 seconds. Feel free to change this value to anywhere from 1 to 10 seconds.

Also by default this addon will scan for all queue types (Tank, Healer, and DPS) as well as all dungeons and raids. Head into the options to fine-tune your choices.

Usage:
- /ss or /sellsword to bring up the Options
